## My profile

👋 Hi, I’m @SalasmartinD. I’m a Computer Engineering student with a passion for technology, problem-solving, and innovation. I combine technical knowledge with creativity to develop practical solutions and projects.

👀 I’m interested in software development, programming languages, and software security. I also have a strong appreciation for coffee culture, thanks to my barista training, which taught me patience, precision, and attention to detail.

🌱 I’m currently learning Python and improving my skills in C, my primary programming language. One of my personal projects involves automating a web page using Python. I aim to explore more automation ideas as a hobby and a way to enhance my programming expertise.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that software security, web backend development, or creative programming ideas. I value teamwork and enjoy contributing to projects where I can share and learn new skills.
